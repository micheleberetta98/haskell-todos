# Haskell Todos

This is a little project in Haskell that handles todos from a file.

## Getting started

You will need [stack](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) to build and run this project.
Once you have everything installed use:

- `stack build` for building
- `stack test` to run tests
- `stack run haskell-todos-exe [filename]` to run the program
